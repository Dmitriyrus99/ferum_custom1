# User Stories and Functional Requirements

- To illustrate how Ferum Customizations will be used in practice, this section presents a series of user stories for each major role in the system.
- Each story describes a typical scenario, the goal of the user, and the acceptance criteria (outcomes) indicating successful fulfillment of the requirement.
- These stories tie together the previously described processes and features from an end-user perspective.
