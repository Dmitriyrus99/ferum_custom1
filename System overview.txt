System overview
Ferum Customizations is built on ERPNext (Frappe v15) and automates key processes of a fire safety company: project and contract management, service request processing, report and invoice generation, HR/salary management and KPI analytics

Architecture
The hybrid scheme combines monolithic ERPNext (master data and DocTypes) with an external web application: FastAPI/Node.js backend and React frontend for advanced interfaces. Components interact via REST and webhooks, which allows evolution towards microservices

Key business processes
Project & Contract Management – creating/maintaining projects and objects, notifications and uniqueness checks

Service Request Management – registration and routing of requests, notifications, SLA control

Work Reporting – generating a ServiceReport with a list of works and attachments, automatic closure of requests

Invoicing & Payments – invoicing clients, accounting for incoming contractor invoices, synchronization with Google Sheets

HR & Payroll Management – calculating salaries via PayrollEntryCustom and access rights control

Document & Attachment Management – centralized work with files and uploading to Google Drive

Monitoring & Analytics – collecting metrics, logging and KPI analytics

Technology stack
ERPNext/Frappe, FastAPI (Python 3.10+), React (TS/JS), bots on Aiogram/WhatsApp, Google Workspace (Sheets, Drive), Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, Prometheus and Sentry, JWT authentication with 2FA, Nginx and rate limiting

Main data entities (DocTypes)
ServiceProject – client contract/project, includes ServiceObjects and requests

ServiceRequest – service request, linked to an object and ServiceReport

ServiceObject – client’s serviced object/equipment

ServiceReport – certificate of work performed with ServiceReportWorkItem and ServiceReportDocumentItem tables

CustomAttachment – unified storage of files and links to Google Drive

Invoice – invoices to clients and contractors, linking to projects and payment statuses

PayrollEntryCustom – advanced accounting of employee salaries

Integrations
Google Sheets & Drive – invoice synchronization and document upload, table update via API

Telegram/WhatsApp bots – notifications, receiving requests and commands users

Prometheus & Sentry – performance monitoring and error logging for rapid response

Additionally – HTTPS/Nginx, integration with external systems (1C/CRM) via export/import, possible synchronization of Google calendars
